## Documentation


#### Overview

By default, Magento facilitates product search and layered navigation with provisions to filter by attribute option values. When there are a lot of attribute values, the page length grows very long, and the end user finds it difficult to select the appropriate filter values. We offer a solution to this problem for all Magento developers from our experience.

Easy Filtering is used to provide search functionality for attribute values in layered navigation. If you have a number of options in product filters, this plugin will display only five of the filter options and provide a scrollbar to find remaining filters, also there will be a search box where you can search for filter options by typing their names.


#### Using this extension you will benefit following features:

* Neat UI for search and navigation filter.
* Solution to optimize the page length due to the number of attribute values.
* Scrollbar for each and every attribute which has more than 5 values.
* Search option for the attribute when it has more than 5 values.
* Easier the customer experience results in betterment in the business
